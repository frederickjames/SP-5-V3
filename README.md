# SP-5 V3

This project documents the work I've done in an attempt to make the Two Trees SP-5 V3 printer produce quality prints faster than the ol' reliable Ender 3 Pro. I hope some of this can help the community that, like me, purchases ~~cheap~~ less expensive stuff and enjoys the tinkering process.

### Fixing Motion System

The linear rails were not smooth. On my priner the y-axis was particularly bad.  I finally got over my fear of losing all my bearings and broke down the linear rails to clean and lubricate.  I used Liquid Wrench to clean the rails and underside of the carriage then lubed with a little extra Super Lube applied by syringe.

To remove the carriage from the rails, invert the rail so the carriage is on the bottom the slowly slide it off the end of the rail trying to keep it as level as possible.  Once removed you'll see a row of ball bearings lightly held in place by a thin, flexible wire.  Take extra care when cleaning the underside of the carriage as any slight bump can cause the ball bearings to go flying (I wouldn't know anything about that).
